// *installation/upgrade/conversion* only.

// change the same flag in the include/constants.inc.php file, not this
// file.

// 1. DO NOT LEAVE DEBUG MODE ENABLED
// 2. DELETE THESE FILES AS SOON AS YOU'RE DONE WITH THEM
// 3. Batteries not included. Void where applicable. Not suitable for kittens.
